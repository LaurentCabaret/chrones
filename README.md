What is a chrone
================

Apart from an extraordinary literary object found in the masterpiece [La Horde du Contrevent][1], a chrone is a class that allows you to set up timers that measure the time between their creation and their destruction and save this information in a file (csv format).

Usage

- Import `chrone.cpp` and `chrone.hpp` in your project
